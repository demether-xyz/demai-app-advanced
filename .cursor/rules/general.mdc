# General

- We are building the UI/UX for the brand, generalize as you go from styles/global.css to reusable components
- Front and Back end are running and reload automatically
- Use clean and non-verbose code
- For Backend, always use poetry, we use FastAPI
- For Frontend use pnpm
- Don't create README / documentation unless asked
- DONT RUN any FE/BE, I will run them manually, as you change they refresh/reload. Can you use curl if needed
- DONT try to build unless asked
