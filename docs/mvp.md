## Technical Stack Considerations

### Frontend

- React/Next.js for modern UI
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Web3 libraries for blockchain interaction

### Backend

- AI integration (OpenAI/Anthropic APIs)
- Blockchain RPC connections
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Database for plan and history storage

### Integrations

- Telegram Bot API
- Multiple blockchain networks
- DeFi protocol APIs
- Price feed services

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1

- [ ] Functional UI with AI chat
- [ ] User can interact with AI smoothly
- [ ] Responsive design works on all devices

### Phase 2

- [ ] AI generates coherent action plans
- [ ] Users can review and modify plans
- [ ] Simulation shows expected outcomes

### Phase 3

- [ ] Successfully execute real blockchain transactions
- [ ] Users can connect wallets and sign transactions
- [ ] Block-based plan execution works end-to-end

### Phase 4

- [ ] Telegram notifications work reliably
- [ ] Users receive timely updates
- [ ] Full monitoring and alert system operational

## Risk Mitigation

- **Security**: Extensive testing of wallet connections and transaction signing
- **User Experience**: Continuous user feedback and iteration
- **Technical**: Fallback mechanisms for failed transactions
- **Regulatory**: Compliance considerations for automated trading

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment
2. Create basic UI mockups and wireframes
3. Implement Phase 1 features
4. User testing and feedback collection
5. Iterate and move to Phase 2
